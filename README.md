# ICO

● Our ICO will be a Smart Contract that accepts ETH in exchange for our own token named Cryptos (CRPT);
● The Cryptos token is a fully compliant ERC20 token and will be generated at the ICO time;
● Investors will send ETH to the ICO contract’s address and in return, they’ll get an amount of
Cryptos;
● There will be a deposit address (EOA account) that automatically receives the ETH sent to the ICO contract;
● CRPT token price in wei is: 1CRPT = 0.001Eth = 10**15 wei, 1Eth = 1000 CRPT);
● The minimum investment is 0.01 ETH and the maximum investment is 5 ETH;
● The ICO Hardcap is 300 ETH;
● The ICO will have an admin that specifies when the ICO starts and ends;
● The ICO ends when the Hardcap or the end time is reached (whichever comes first);
● The CRPT token will be tradable only after a specific time set by the admin;
● In case of an emergency the admin could stop the ICO and could also change the deposit address in case it gets compromised;
● The ICO can be in one of the following states: beforeStart, running, afterEnd, halted;
● And we’ll also implement the possibility to burn the tokens that were not sold in the ICO;
● After an investment in the ICO the Invest event will be emitted;
